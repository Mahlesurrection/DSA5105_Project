# Introduction
This is the NUS DSA5105 course project. I have completed several tasks on CIFAR-10 dataset.

The `.ipynb` file includes 3 parts:
- **CIFAR-10 Dataset Overview**
    - Introduction of the dataset
    - Visualization of the dataset
    - K-fold dataloader for the dataset
- **Supervised Learning**:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Random Forest
    - Convolutional Nearual Network
- **Unsupervised Learning**:
    - Autoencoder
    - KMeans Clustering
    - Autoencoder + KMeans

And I used k-fold cross validation in `Logistic Regression` and `Convolutional Nearual Network` parts to evaluate the model performance.

The dataset is in "`./data`" and all of the trained model are in "`./model`", and I have annotated all the code for the training section, if you have downloaded the `./model` folder, you can run each code block within 30 seconds.
